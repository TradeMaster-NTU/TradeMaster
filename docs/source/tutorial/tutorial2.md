## Task
Portfolio management is the action of continuous reallocation of a capital into a number of financial assets periodically.

- Deterministic Policy Gradient
- Portfolio-Vector Memor


Here is the construction of the EIIE:

Here is a [tutorial](https://github.com/DVampire/TradeMasterReBuild/tree/main/tutorial/EIIE.ipynb) about how you can build EIIE in a few lines of codes using TradeMaster.

# Prerequisites

In this section we demonstrate how to set up an environment with PyTorch.

TradeMaster supports different operating systems: Linux, Windows and macOS. It requires Python xx, CUDA xx and PyTorch xx.


**Step 0.** Download and install Miniconda from the [official website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Step 2: Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- Please follow the steps in this [blog](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-anaconda-on-ubuntu-18-04/)

Step 3: Install OpenAI

- Open an ubuntu terminal and type:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cmake libopenmpi-dev python3-dev zlib1g-dev libgl1-mesa-glx swig
   ```
Step 4: Install [`TradeMaster`](https://github.com/TradeMaster-NTU/TradeMaster)
- Open a terminal amd type 
  ```
  conda create --name TradeMaster python=3.7.13
  ```
  to install a new conda environment for `TradeMaster`
- Install `TradeMaster`
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/TradeMaster-NTU/TradeMaster.git
  ```
- Open the folder `TradeMaster` and open a terminal under the same position

   cd ./requirement
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
   ```
## MacOS Installation

Step 1: Install [`Anaconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

- Follow Anaconda’s instruction: [`macOS graphical install`](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/), to install the newest version of Anaconda.

- Open your terminal and type: `which python`, it should show:
  ```
  /Users/your_user_name/opt/anaconda3/bin/python
  ```
  It means that your Python interpreter path has been pinned to Anaconda’s python version. If it shows something like this:
  ```
  /Users/your_user_name/opt/anaconda3/bin/python
  ```
  It means that you still use the default python path, you either fix it and pin it to the anaconda path (try this [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-successfully-install-anaconda-on-a-mac-and-actually-get-it-to-work-53ce18025f97)), or you can use Anaconda Navigator to open a terminal manually.

Step 2: Install [`Homebrew`](https://brew.sh/)

- Open a terminal and make sure that you have installed Anaconda.
- Install Homebrew:
  ```
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```
Step 3: Install [`OpenAI`](https://github.com/openai/baselines)

Installation of system packages on Mac requires Homebrew. With Homebrew installed, run the following in your terminal:
```
brew install cmake openmpi
```
Step 4: Install [`TradeMaster`](https://github.com/TradeMaster-NTU/TradeMaster)
- Open a terminal amd type 
  ```
  conda create --name TradeMaster python=3.7.13
  ```
  to install a new conda environment for `TradeMaster`
- Install `TradeMaster`
  ```
   git clone https://github.com/TradeMaster-NTU/TradeMaster.git
  ```
- Open the folder `TradeMaster` and open a terminal under the same position
- Install the dependency of `TradeMaster`, run the command:
   ```
   conda activate TradeMaster
   cd ./requirement
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch
   ```
  
## Verify the installation

## Customize Installation

### Install on Google Colab

### Using TradeMaster with Docker
Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Step 1: Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
- Please follow the steps in this [blog](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- To check whether the Docker has been installed properly, type `docker version`, it should show:
  ```
  Client:
   Cloud integration: v1.0.29
   Version:           20.10.17
   API version:       1.41
   Go version:        go1.17.11
   Git commit:        100c701
   Built:             Mon Jun  6 23:09:02 2022
   OS/Arch:           windows/amd64
   Context:           default
   Experimental:      true

  Server: Docker Desktop 4.12.0 (85629)
   Engine:
    Version:          20.10.17
    API version:      1.41 (minimum version 1.12)
    Go version:       go1.17.11
    Git commit:       a89b842
    Built:            Mon Jun  6 23:01:23 2022
    OS/Arch:          linux/amd64
    Experimental:     false
   containerd:
    Version:          1.6.8
    GitCommit:        9cd3357b7fd7218e4aec3eae239db1f68a5a6ec6
   runc:
    Version:          1.1.4
    GitCommit:        v1.1.4-0-g5fd4c4d
   docker-init:
    Version:          0.19.0
    GitCommit:        de40ad0
  ```

Step 2: Build the docker image from [dockerfile](https://github.com/TradeMaster-NTU/TradeMaster/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile)
- Install `TradeMaster`
  ```
   git clone https://github.com/TradeMaster-NTU/TradeMaster.git
  ```
- Create image from the project docker file.

  If your chip is arm-architectured, open terminal or cmd in the position of the project and type
  ```
  cd ./docker/arm
  docker build -t="trademaster:0.1" .
  ```
  If you chip is x86-architectured, open terminal or cmd in the position of the project and type
  ```
  cd ./docker/x86
  docker build -t="trademaster:0.1" .
  ```
  It will take a while before the image is built.

Step 3: Test whether the image is installed correctly

- Open the terminal in the project position and type
  ```
  docker image ls
  ```
  It should shows 
  ```
  REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
  trademaster   0.1       02801f755797   4 minutes ago   15GB 
  ```
- Create a container and run an experiment to see whether the installation is successful
  ```
  docker run -it trademaster:0.1
  python experiment/AT/DeepScalper/experiment.py
  ```

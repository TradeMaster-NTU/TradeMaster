/home/zcxia/TradeMaster/data_synthesis/TimeGAN/timegan.py:304:12: WARNING: *.save requires manual check. (This warning is only applicable if the code saves a tf.Keras model) Keras model.save now saves to the Tensorflow SavedModel format by default, instead of HDF5. To continue saving to HDF5, add the argument save_format='h5' to the save() function.
